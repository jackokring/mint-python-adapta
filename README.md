# A template for using `libadapta` with python

There are some scripts.

- `Ã¬nstall.sh` to add the `.deb` files, `pip install` and python syntax symbols.
- `build.sh` to build the `.gz`, `.whl` and install the package.
- `freeze.sh` to make `requirements.txt` before a `git add`.

Change the paths from `xapp_adapta` as the name must be unique on `PyPI` if
you intend to upload a derivative work there.

Thanks
